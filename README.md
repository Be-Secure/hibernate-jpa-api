hibernate-jpa-api
=================

Clean-room definition of JPA APIs intended for transitory use in Hibernate JPA development.

See http://java.net/projects/jpa-spec/downloads for drafts used.

The name of this project (in the Gradle sense) is explicitly set in settings.gradle to include the JPA version
in the name.  The reason being that we want the name of all uploaded artifacts to include the JPA name; the version
is our development version.  Keep this in mind moving from one JPA 1.0 to 2.0 or from 2.0 to 2.1 etc.
